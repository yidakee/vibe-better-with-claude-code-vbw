```

Store the plugin root path output above as `{plugin-root}` for use in script invocations below. Replace `{plugin-root}` with the literal `Plugin root` value from Context whenever a step below references a script or reference file.

Existing mapping:
```text
!`ls .vbw-planning/codebase/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No codebase mapping found"`
```
META.md:
```
!`cat .vbw-planning/codebase/META.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No META.md found"`
```
Project files:
```text
!`ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod Gemfile build.gradle pom.xml 2>/dev/null || echo "No standard project files found"`
```
Git HEAD:
```text
!`git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "no-git"`
```
Agent Teams:
```text
!`echo "${CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS:-0}"`
```

## Guard

1. **Not initialized** (no .vbw-planning/ dir): STOP "Run /vbw:init first."
2. **No git:** WARN "Not a git repo -- incremental mapping disabled." Continue in full mode.
3. **Empty project:** No source files → STOP: "No source code found to map."

## Steps

### Step 1: Parse arguments and detect mode

- **--incremental**: force incremental refresh
- **--package=name**: scope to single monorepo package
- **--tier=solo|duo|quad**: force specific tier (overrides auto-detection)

**Mode detection:** If META.md exists + git repo: compare `git_hash` to HEAD. <20% files changed = incremental, else full. No META.md or no git = full. Store MAPPING_MODE and CHANGED_FILES.

### Step 1.5: Size codebase and select tier

Count source files (Glob), excluding: .vbw-planning/, node_modules/, .git/, vendor/, dist/, build/, target/, .next/, __pycache__/, .venv/, coverage/. If --package, scope to that dir. Store SOURCE_FILE_COUNT.

| Tier | Files | Strategy | Scouts |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| solo | <200 | Orchestrator maps inline | 0 |
| duo | 200-1000 | 2 scouts, combined domains | 2 |
| quad | 1000+ | Full 4-scout team | 4 |

Overrides: --tier flag forces tier. Agent Teams not enabled → force solo (`⚠ Agent Teams not enabled — using solo mode`). `prefer_teams='never'` in config → force solo (`⚠ prefer_teams=never — using solo mode`).
Display: `◆ Sizing: {SOURCE_FILE_COUNT} source files → {tier} mode`

Read `prefer_teams` before applying tier:
```bash
PREFER_TEAMS=$(bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/normalize-prefer-teams.sh" .vbw-planning/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "auto")
```
If `PREFER_TEAMS` is `never`, force solo regardless of file count or --tier flag.

### Step 2: Detect monorepo

**JS/Node patterns:** Check lerna.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, packages/ or apps/ with sub-package.json, root workspaces field.

**Multi-component detection:** Count distinct build system roots at different paths. Build system markers: package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, build.gradle, pom.xml, *.xcodeproj, Podfile, pubspec.yaml. If 2+ markers found at different directory levels (not just root), treat as monorepo.

If monorepo + --package: scope to that package.

### Step 3: Execute mapping (tier-branched)

**Step 3-solo:** Orchestrator analyzes each domain sequentially, writes to `.vbw-planning/codebase/`:

- Domain 1 (Tech Stack): STACK.md + DEPENDENCIES.md
- Domain 2 (Architecture): ARCHITECTURE.md + STRUCTURE.md
- Domain 3 (Quality): CONVENTIONS.md + TESTING.md
- Domain 4 (Concerns): CONCERNS.md

Display ✓ per domain. After all 7 docs written, skip Step 3.5, go to Step 4.

**Step 3-duo:** **Pre-TeamCreate cleanup:** `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/clean-stale-teams.sh" 2>/dev/null || true`. Create team via TeamCreate: `team_name="vbw-map-duo"`, `description="Codebase Map (duo)"` with 2 Scouts via TaskCreate. **Set `subagent_type: "vbw:vbw-scout"` on each Scout TaskCreate.** Do not pass `isolation`, `cwd`, `working_dir`, `workingDirectory`, or `workdir` on any TaskCreate.

Scout A (Tech + Architecture): analyze tech stack, deps, architecture, structure. Write findings directly to the output paths. Include in prompt:
```
<output_paths>
.vbw-planning/codebase/STACK.md
.vbw-planning/codebase/DEPENDENCIES.md
.vbw-planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md
.vbw-planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md
</output_paths>
```
Mode: {MAPPING_MODE}. After writing all 4 files, send a `scout_findings` message (domain: "tech-and-architecture") with `cross_cutting` findings only (file contents already written). Schema ref: `{plugin-root}/references/handoff-schemas.md`

Scout B (Quality + Concerns): analyze quality, conventions, testing, debt, risks. Write findings directly to the output paths. Include in prompt:
```
<output_paths>
.vbw-planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md
.vbw-planning/codebase/TESTING.md
.vbw-planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md
</output_paths>
```
Mode: {MAPPING_MODE}. After writing all 3 files, send a `scout_findings` message (domain: "quality-and-concerns") with `cross_cutting` findings only. Schema ref: `{plugin-root}/references/handoff-schemas.md`

**Scout model (effort-gated):** Fast/Turbo: `Model: haiku`. Thorough/Balanced: inherit session model.
**Scout turn budget (effort-gated):** Resolve with `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/resolve-agent-max-turns.sh" scout .vbw-planning/config.json "{effort}"`. If `SCOUT_MAX_TURNS` is non-empty, pass `maxTurns: ${SCOUT_MAX_TURNS}` to each Scout TaskCreate. If `SCOUT_MAX_TURNS` is empty, do NOT include maxTurns (omitting it = unlimited).
**Skill pre-evaluation:** Before composing Scout task descriptions, evaluate installed skills visible in your system context — read each skill's description and select all materially helpful installed skills for codebase mapping, including adjacent/supporting domain skills surfaced by the prompt, logs, error text, related files, or stack context — not just the single most direct skill. The spawned prompt MUST begin with exactly one explicit skill outcome block: use `<skill_activation>{For each selected skill: "Call Skill({skill-name})"}</skill_activation>` when one or more installed skills are preselected at orchestration time, or `<skill_no_activation>Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.</skill_no_activation>` when none are preselected. Silent omission of both blocks is invalid. After evaluating, state the skill outcome in your response (e.g., "Skills: activating {skill-name}" or "Skills: none preselected — {reason}") so the user has visibility before the agent is spawned. Example: if the prompt or error mentions SwiftData, include `swiftdata` alongside relevant test/build/debug skills. After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting — do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.

If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning each duo-mode Scout. If the helper prints a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block, paste it immediately after the follow-up-read sentence in the spawned payload. Otherwise omit that block.

**Payload prefix (duo mode):** Use this as the FIRST lines of each Scout task body:
```text
<skill_activation>
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-1}').
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-2}').
</skill_activation>
After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting — do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
<skill_follow_up_files>
{If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning and replace this block with the emitted absolute follow-up file paths. Omit this block when the helper prints nothing.}
</skill_follow_up_files>
```
When no installed skills apply, use this prefix instead:
```text
<skill_no_activation>
Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.
</skill_no_activation>
After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting — do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
```

**MCP tools:** If code-analysis MCP tools are available (architecture extraction, dependency graphs, call hierarchy, symbol search), note the specific tools in each Scout's task prompt so Scouts can leverage them alongside Glob/Read/Grep.

Wait for all findings. Proceed to Step 3.5.

---

**Step 3-quad:** **Pre-TeamCreate cleanup:** `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/clean-stale-teams.sh" 2>/dev/null || true`. Create team via TeamCreate: `team_name="vbw-map-quad"`, `description="Codebase Map (quad)"` with 4 Scouts via TaskCreate. **Set `subagent_type: "vbw:vbw-scout"` on each Scout TaskCreate.** Do not pass `isolation`, `cwd`, `working_dir`, `workingDirectory`, or `workdir` on any TaskCreate. Each Scout writes its domain files directly via `<output_paths>`, then sends a `scout_findings` message with `cross_cutting` findings only (file contents already written). Schema ref: `{plugin-root}/references/handoff-schemas.md`
- Scout 1 (Tech Stack): `<output_paths>` = `.vbw-planning/codebase/STACK.md`, `.vbw-planning/codebase/DEPENDENCIES.md`
- Scout 2 (Architecture): `<output_paths>` = `.vbw-planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.vbw-planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md`
- Scout 3 (Quality): `<output_paths>` = `.vbw-planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md`, `.vbw-planning/codebase/TESTING.md`
- Scout 4 (Concerns): `<output_paths>` = `.vbw-planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`

Security: PreToolUse hook handles enforcement. **Scout model:** same as duo. **Scout turn budget:** same as duo (pass `maxTurns: ${SCOUT_MAX_TURNS}` when non-empty, omit when empty). **Skill pre-evaluation:** Before composing Scout task descriptions, evaluate installed skills visible in your system context — read each skill's description and select all materially helpful installed skills for codebase mapping, including adjacent/supporting domain skills surfaced by the prompt, logs, error text, related files, or stack context — not just the single most direct skill. The spawned prompt MUST begin with exactly one explicit skill outcome block: use `<skill_activation>{For each selected skill: "Call Skill({skill-name})"}</skill_activation>` when one or more installed skills are preselected at orchestration time, or `<skill_no_activation>Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.</skill_no_activation>` when none are preselected. Silent omission of both blocks is invalid. After evaluating, state the skill outcome in your response (e.g., "Skills: activating {skill-name}" or "Skills: none preselected — {reason}") so the user has visibility before the agent is spawned. Example: if the prompt or error mentions SwiftData, include `swiftdata` alongside relevant test/build/debug skills. After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting — do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references. If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning each quad-mode Scout. If the helper prints a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block, paste it immediately after the follow-up-read sentence in the spawned payload. Otherwise omit that block. **MCP tools:** If code-analysis MCP tools are available (architecture extraction, dependency graphs, call hierarchy, symbol search), note the specific tools in each Scout's task prompt so Scouts can leverage them alongside Glob/Read/Grep.

**Payload prefix (quad mode):** Use this as the FIRST lines of each Scout task body:
```text
<skill_activation>
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-1}').
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-2}').
</skill_activation>
After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting — do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
<skill_follow_up_files>

```

**Scout communication (effort-gated):**

| Effort | Messages |
|--------|----------|
| Thorough | Cross-cutting findings + contradiction flags for INDEX.md Validation Notes |
| Balanced | Cross-cutting findings only |
| Fast | Blockers only |

Use targeted `message` not `broadcast`. Wait for all findings. Display ✓ per scout.

### Step 3.5: Verify mapping documents written by Scouts

**Skip if solo** (docs already written). Scouts wrote files directly via `<output_paths>`. Verify all 7 docs exist in `.vbw-planning/codebase/`: STACK.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md, CONCERNS.md. If any are missing, log `⚠ Missing: {filename}` and write a placeholder from the `scout_findings` message content (fall back to cross_cutting text). Use `cross_cutting` findings from scout_findings messages for INDEX.md Validation Notes in Step 4.

### Step 4: Synthesize INDEX.md and PATTERNS.md

Read all 7 docs. Produce:
- **INDEX.md:** Cross-referenced index with key findings + "Validation Notes" for contradictions
- **PATTERNS.md:** Recurring patterns: architectural, naming, quality, concern, dependency

### Step 5: Create META.md and present summary

**HARD GATE — Shutdown before presenting results:** Solo: no team, skip. Duo/Quad: send `shutdown_request` to each teammate, wait for `shutdown_response` (approved=true) delivered via SendMessage tool call (NOT plain text). If a teammate responds in plain text instead of calling SendMessage, re-send the `shutdown_request`. If rejected, re-request (max 3 attempts per teammate — then proceed). Call TeamDelete. **Post-TeamDelete residual cleanup:** `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/clean-stale-teams.sh" 2>/dev/null || true`. Verify: after TeamDelete, there must be ZERO active teammates. If teardown stalls, advise the user to run `/vbw:doctor --cleanup`. Only THEN proceed to META.md and user output. Failure to shut down leaves agents running and consuming API credits.

Write META.md: mapped_at, git_hash, file_count, document list, mode, monorepo flag, mapping_tier, mcp_tools_used (tool names or "none").
